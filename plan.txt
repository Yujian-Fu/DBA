# Plan:
# Implement: Krum, Multi-Krum

# Noise privacy preserving

# New Model and new Dataset ï¼ˆLarger model and larger dataset)

# Image distraction: With the same number of pixels, What is the most important  

# Visualize the parameter: which layer changes the most? Make the defend layer by layer They will only change the parameter in specific layer

# The forget curve of the attack model

Dataset: CIFAR, Tiny, Mnist

1. Is the defend system working?
2. Run Tiny set 
3. Run multi-mechanism


difference privacy: add noise
